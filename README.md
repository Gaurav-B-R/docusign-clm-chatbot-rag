# DocuSign CLM Support Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Welcome to the **DocuSign CLM Support Chatbot** repository! 🚀

This project aims to build an intelligent chatbot that can answer user queries about DocuSign CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. By combining advanced natural language processing (NLP) models with efficient document retrieval systems, this chatbot will provide accurate and context-aware responses to user questions.

---

## 🛠️ **Project Overview**
- **Objective**: 
  - To create a scalable and reliable chatbot for DocuSign CLM support using publicly available documentation, FAQs, and guides.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - Retrieval of relevant documents from a knowledge base.
  - Embedding generation using Hugging Face transformers.
  - Context-aware response generation using OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face GPT-Neo.
  - Scalable architecture leveraging AWS services.

---

## 🔧 **Tech Stack**
This project will use the following technologies:
- **AWS**: S3, OpenSearch, Lambda, SageMaker, and CloudFront.
- **Vector Database**: Amazon OpenSearch for semantic search.
- **NLP Models**:
  - Hugging Face (`all-mpnet-base-v2`) for embedding generation.
  - OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face GPT-Neo for response generation.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for building an interactive chatbot UI.
- **Backend**: Python (with LangChain for RAG pipeline orchestration).

## 🗂️ **Project Roadmap**
1. **Data Collection**: Scrape and preprocess FAQs and guides from DocuSign's official support website.
2. **Embedding Generation**: Use Hugging Face transformers to create vector representations of the collected data.
3. **Document Retrieval**: Implement a semantic search engine using Amazon OpenSearch.
4. **Response Generation**: Integrate OpenAI GPT-3.5 or GPT-Neo to refine and generate user-friendly answers.
5. **Frontend Development**: Build a chatbot interface using Streamlit.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the complete application using AWS services.
