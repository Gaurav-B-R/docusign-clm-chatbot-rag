# DocuSign CLM Support Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Welcome to the **DocuSign CLM Support Chatbot** repository! üöÄ

This project aims to build an intelligent chatbot that can answer user queries about DocuSign CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. By combining advanced natural language processing (NLP) models with efficient document retrieval systems, this chatbot will provide accurate and context-aware responses to user questions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Overview**
- **Objective**: 
  - To create a scalable and reliable chatbot for DocuSign CLM support using publicly available documentation, FAQs, and guides.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - Retrieval of relevant documents from a knowledge base.
  - Embedding generation using Hugging Face transformers.
  - Context-aware response generation using OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face GPT-Neo.
  - Scalable architecture leveraging AWS services.

---

## üîß **Tech Stack**
This project will use the following technologies:
- **AWS**: S3, OpenSearch, Lambda, SageMaker, Textract, API Gateway, and Amplify.
- **Vector Database**: Amazon OpenSearch for semantic search.
- **NLP Models**:
  - Hugging Face (`all-mpnet-base-v2`) for embedding generation.
  - OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face GPT-Neo for response generation.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for building an interactive chatbot UI.
- **Backend**: Python (with LangChain for RAG pipeline orchestration).

## üóÇÔ∏è **Project Roadmap**
1. **Define the Scope and Architecture**
   - Objective: Build a chatbot to assist with DocuSign CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) queries using RAG.
   - Architecture Overview: User query ‚Üí LLM (with RAG) ‚Üí Document Retrieval ‚Üí Answer Generation.
   - Tech Stack Highlights: AWS services, open-source tools, and integration with free LLM APIs.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Source: Gather DocuSign CLM documentation, FAQs, and relevant PDFs for indexing.
   - Tools:
     - Amazon S3: Store documents (free tier up to 5GB).
     - Amazon Textract: Extract text from PDFs (limited free-tier usage).
     - AWS Lambda: Automate text extraction and preprocessing.

3. **Retrieval System**
   - Objective: Set up a search index to retrieve relevant documents in real time.
   - Tools:
     - OpenSearch Service (AWS): Create a search index for document retrieval (free tier available with limited usage).
     - Alternative (if needed): Use Weaviate (open-source) or Pinecone (free tier).

4. **LLM Integration**
   - LLM Options:
     - OpenAI GPT (Free API Access): Use OpenAI‚Äôs API with the free-tier credits.
     - Hugging Face Transformers (AWS SageMaker): Fine-tune an open-source model like GPT-2 or Llama 2.
   - Deployment on AWS:
     - AWS SageMaker: Host your fine-tuned LLM model (free-tier instance).

5. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline**
   - How to Implement:
     - Use a framework like LangChain to combine retrieval and LLM seamlessly.
     - Query documents from OpenSearch, pass results to the LLM, and generate responses.
   - Compute Resources:
     - AWS Lambda: Process RAG requests.
     - AWS API Gateway: Set up API endpoints for chatbot queries (free tier).

6. **Chatbot Frontend**
   - Objective: Create a simple and user-friendly interface.
   - Tools:
     - Streamlit (Open Source): Build a lightweight web app for interaction.
     - AWS Amplify: Host the chatbot frontend (free-tier resources for hosting).

7. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Testing:
     - Test the pipeline locally and with real-world DocuSign CLM queries.
     - Optimize retrieval accuracy and response quality.
   - Deployment:
     - Deploy the full pipeline on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Fargate (both offer free-tier usage).
